# AlmaLinux Accounts Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 2026-01-24*

This Privacy Policy explains how **AlmaLinux Accounts** (known internally as Astra) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data.

This policy applies to AlmaLinux Accounts. It does not cover third-party sites linked from AlmaLinux Accounts, or other AlmaLinux community services that have their own privacy practices.

### Key points

- **Public by default:** Some profile information may be visible to other users (and in some contexts to the public). You can enable a “private profile” to reduce what others can see.
- **Retention:** We retain your personal data until you delete your account.
- **Privacy contact:** privacy@almalinux.org

## Who we are

AlmaLinux Accounts is operated for the AlmaLinux community and membership programs.

- **Data controller:** AlmaLinux OS Foundation ("we", "us")
- **Service:** AlmaLinux Accounts (account, membership, and election management)

## Scope of this notice

This policy covers personal data processed when you:

- Create and use an AlmaLinux Accounts account
- Manage your profile and security settings
- Apply for or manage Foundation memberships and organizational affiliations
- Participate in elections run through AlmaLinux Accounts
- Receive emails generated by AlmaLinux Accounts

It does not cover third-party websites you may visit via links in AlmaLinux Accounts.

## Publicly available information

AlmaLinux Accounts is an account system for an open community. That means some information may be visible to other users (and may be displayed in public-facing contexts when needed for community processes).

- **What may be visible:** Your username, profile fields you choose to provide, and group affiliations may be shown to other users.
- **Private profile:** If you enable the “private profile” setting, AlmaLinux Accounts is designed to hide or redact key personal details (such as your name and email address) from other users. Some information may still be visible where necessary for the service (for example, your username in administrative workflows or community-facing election candidate lists).

## A note about public forums and archives

AlmaLinux Accounts is not a discussion forum. If you participate in AlmaLinux community spaces (for example, mailing lists, issue trackers, or forums), those contributions may be public and may remain in archives even if you later delete your AlmaLinux Accounts account.

## Personal data we collect

AlmaLinux Accounts uses a combination of (1) a directory and authentication system (**FreeIPA**) and (2) AlmaLinux Accounts’s application database for workflows like memberships and elections.

### Account and identity data

- Username (account identifier)
- Name and display name fields (as provided)
- Email address
- Account status indicators (for example, whether an account is locked)
- Group memberships (including indirect group memberships)

### Profile and preference data (optional, if you choose to provide it)

- Pronouns
- Locale and timezone
- Website and RSS feed links
- Chat/IRC handle
- GitHub and GitLab usernames
- Bug tracker email address (Bugzilla)
- A “private profile” setting that controls how your profile is displayed to others

### Address and location data (optional)

Address details are optional in general. However, when you submit a membership request, AlmaLinux Accounts requires your country code to perform embargo/sanctions compliance checks.

If you choose to provide additional address details, AlmaLinux Accounts may store and use:

- Street, city, state/province, postal/ZIP code
- Country code (required for membership requests; used for embargo/sanctions compliance checks)

### Keys and security data

To help secure your account and support common developer workflows, AlmaLinux Accounts may process:

- SSH public keys
- GPG key IDs
- One-time password (OTP/2FA) tokens (including secrets used to set up OTP)
- Password-reset and email-verification metadata (for example, timestamps used to validate tokens)

### Membership, organization, and workflow data

AlmaLinux Accounts supports membership applications and organizational sponsorship workflows. It may store:

- Membership applications/requests and your submitted answers (including free-form text)
- Committee review actions, decisions, timestamps, and reasons
- Notes and logs created as part of membership and administration workflows (free-form text may include personal data)
- Organization records, including:
  - Organization representative username
  - Website and branding information (including uploaded logos)
  - Contact details for business, PR/marketing, and technical contacts
  - Additional information you provide (free-form text)

### Election and voting data

If you participate in elections run through AlmaLinux Accounts, the system may process:

- Eligibility information (based on membership/sponsorship status)
- Candidate nominations (candidate username and who nominated them)
- Voting credentials (used to authenticate a ballot submission)
- Ballots (your vote rankings) and audit data used to verify election integrity

**Vote anonymity:** AlmaLinux Accounts is designed to remove the stored link between a voting credential and your account after an election (see “How long we keep data” below).

### Email data

AlmaLinux Accounts sends operational and workflow emails (for example, account verification, membership status updates, election notifications).

For reliability and administration, AlmaLinux Accounts’s email queue stores:

- Recipient email address
- Email subject and content
- The template name and the workflow details used to create the message (which can include personal data). For example, a membership email may include your username and membership status.

### Technical data

When you use AlmaLinux Accounts, our systems necessarily process some technical data to operate and secure the service. This may include:

- IP address
- Date and time of requests
- Browser and device information (for example, user agent string)
- Error reports and server logs (which may include your username and, in some cases, your email address if it appears in the request)
- Session identifiers and security-related cookies

### Cookies and similar technologies

AlmaLinux Accounts uses cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in and help protect the service (for example, to prevent cross-site request forgery).

- **Essential cookies:** If you disable cookies, AlmaLinux Accounts may not work correctly (and you may not be able to log in).
- **No ads-based tracking:** AlmaLinux Accounts does not use cookies for advertising.

## How we use personal data

We use personal data to:

- Provide and secure access to AlmaLinux Accounts (authentication, account management, fraud and abuse prevention)
- Let you manage your profile and account settings
- Administer memberships, sponsorships, and organizational affiliations
- Run elections, including credential issuance, ballot receipt, tallying, and publishing auditable election artifacts
- Communicate with you about your account and related workflows
- Operate, maintain, debug, and improve AlmaLinux Accounts
- Meet legal and compliance obligations (for example, sanctions/embargo compliance checks where applicable)

## Legal bases for processing (GDPR)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we rely on the following legal bases under GDPR/UK GDPR, depending on the context:

- **Contract / steps prior to contract:** to provide AlmaLinux Accounts services you request (account and membership-related workflows)
- **Legitimate interests:** to operate and secure AlmaLinux Accounts, prevent abuse, and administer community programs
- **Consent:** where you choose to provide optional profile fields or opt into specific features (you can withdraw consent at any time)
- **Legal obligation:** where we must meet legal or regulatory requirements

## How we share personal data

We do not sell your personal data.

We may share personal data in the following cases:

### Infrastructure and service providers (processors)

AlmaLinux Accounts relies on service providers to run the service:

- **FreeIPA (directory/authentication):** AlmaLinux Accounts uses FreeIPA to store and manage key account attributes (profile fields, groups, OTP, SSH keys) and to authenticate users.
- **Email delivery (AWS SES):** email messages are delivered via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) in production.
- **Email delivery status events:** we may receive email delivery status events (for example, bounces and complaints) to help us monitor deliverability. These events may include your email address and delivery status information.
- **Email queueing (django-post-office):** email messages and related metadata are stored in AlmaLinux Accounts’s database for delivery and administration.
- **Address autocomplete/geocoding (Komoot Photon):** if you use address lookup features, your address search input is sent to the Photon service at `https://photon.komoot.io`.
- **Avatar services (Gravatar/LibRAvatar):** if enabled, AlmaLinux Accounts may query avatar providers using an email-derived hash to display a profile image.
- **File/object storage:** uploaded media (such as organization logos) may be stored in an S3-compatible object storage system.

### Other users and public outputs

- **User profiles and groups:** AlmaLinux Accounts may display your profile and group affiliations to other users, depending on your settings.
- **Private profiles:** if you enable the “private profile” setting, AlmaLinux Accounts is designed to redact key details from other users.
- **Elections:** election processes may publish auditable artifacts (for example, anonymized ballots and public audit log entries) so the community can verify results.

### Legal and safety disclosures

We may disclose personal data if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with law, regulation, or lawful requests
- Protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the AlmaLinux community, or the public
- Investigate misuse, abuse, or security incidents

## International transfers

AlmaLinux Accounts’s operators and service providers may process data in countries outside your own. Where GDPR applies and personal data is transferred internationally, we use appropriate safeguards as required by law (for example, standard contractual clauses where applicable).

## How long we keep data

We retain your personal data until you delete your account.

Because AlmaLinux Accounts stores data in both FreeIPA and the AlmaLinux Accounts application database, account deletion can involve multiple systems. If you request account deletion, we will take steps to remove or disable your account and delete personal data associated with it.

### Important exceptions

In limited cases, some data may be retained after account deletion where it is necessary to:

- Protect the security and integrity of AlmaLinux Accounts (for example, investigating abuse or security incidents)
- Comply with legal obligations
- Preserve the integrity of elections and published election results

Where possible, we aim to retain only what is necessary and to minimize what can identify you.

### Verified retention behaviors in AlmaLinux Accounts

- **Membership and sponsorship expiry cleanup:** certain expired membership and sponsorship records are removed as part of scheduled cleanup processes.
- **Election vote anonymization:** after an election closes, AlmaLinux Accounts removes the stored link between a voter account and their voting credential.
- **Election-related email scrubbing:** AlmaLinux Accounts deletes stored email queue records related to a given election.

### Backups and logs

Our infrastructure may include backups and logs. These are protected with access controls and are used for reliability and security. Deleted data may remain in backups for a limited period until those backups expire.

## Your choices and rights

### Account controls

You can typically:

- Update many profile fields directly in AlmaLinux Accounts
- Add, update, or remove SSH keys and other profile information
- Enable or disable OTP/2FA
- Enable a “private profile” option to limit what other users can see

### Your GDPR rights

Where GDPR (or similar laws) applies, you may have the right to:

- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete data
- Request deletion of your personal data
- Restrict or object to processing
- Request data portability
- Withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority

These rights are not absolute; they may be limited where we have a lawful reason to keep or process data (for example, for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance).

### How to exercise your rights

To make a privacy request (access, correction, deletion, restriction/objection, or portability), email us at privacy@almalinux.org.

To help protect your privacy, we will verify your identity before we act on a request. We typically do this by asking you to:

- Email us from the email address associated with your AlmaLinux Accounts account, and/or
- Confirm details we can use to match you to your account, and/or
- If you can still log in, confirm the request from an authenticated AlmaLinux Accounts session (when feasible).

### Timelines

Where GDPR (or similar laws) applies, we will respond to your request within one month of verifying your identity. If a request is complex, we may take up to an additional two months where permitted by law, and we will tell you if an extension is needed.

### What we provide

- **Access / portability:** We will provide a copy of your personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable format (such as JSON).
- **Deletion:** Deleting your account removes personal data associated with your account where applicable. Some information may be retained in anonymized or aggregated form (for example, anonymized election artifacts) or where retention is required for security, legal compliance, or integrity.

## Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect personal data. This includes access controls and security features such as OTP/2FA support.

No system can guarantee 100% security. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately.

## Children

AlmaLinux Accounts is intended for a general open-source community audience and is not directed to children. If you believe a child has provided personal data through AlmaLinux Accounts, contact us so we can take appropriate steps.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

If we make material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to provide additional notice (for example, by posting an announcement in AlmaLinux Accounts or by email).
